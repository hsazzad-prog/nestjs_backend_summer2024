A high-performance, scalable, and developer-friendly backend API built with NestJS, TypeScript, and Node.js. This codebase provides a solid foundation for building robust and efficient APIs for your web applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: NestJS promotes a modular and scalable architecture, making it easy to organize and maintain your codebase as your application grows.
- **TypeScript Support**: TypeScript brings static typing, better tooling, and improved developer productivity to your Node.js applications.
- **Data Validation**: Built-in support for data validation using the powerful `class-validator` library, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Class Serialization**: Seamless class serialization and deserialization with `class-transformer`, simplifying data transformation tasks.
- **File Uploads**: Effortless file upload handling with the `multer` middleware, enabling support for multipart/form-data requests.
- **Testing Ready**: Unit and end-to-end (e2e) testing setup out of the box, ensuring code quality and maintainability.
- **ORM Agnostic**: Flexibility to choose and integrate with any Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, such as Sequelize, Mongoose, or TypeORM.
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean and decoupled code through dependency injection, promoting code reusability and testability.
